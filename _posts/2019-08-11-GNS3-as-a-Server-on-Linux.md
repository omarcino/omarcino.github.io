GNS3 is an astonishing tool to emulate Cisco network topologies. But if it is done as a basic installation on a Windows computer; GNS3 can start consuming high amounts of resources when the transition from simple to more complex network topologies happens, and it wouldnâ€™t be possible to setup advanced switching operations.

One solutions, to avoid the issues mentioned. It is to install GNS3 on Linux as a server and then connect a GNS3 client from any other computer running Windows or Mac.
